## Advanced Debugging and Validation

### The NaN Loss Problem - A Critical Debugging Case Study

Stabilizing the C-based training was the most significant challenge. The model would consistently produce `NaN` (Not a Number) loss values, halting any learning. The debugging process revealed multiple compounding issues:

1.  **Initial Hypothesis (Exploding Gradients)**: Gradient clipping was implemented but did not solve the issue, suggesting a deeper problem.
2.  **The Real Culprit: "Dying ReLU"**: Through extensive logging, we discovered that the standard ReLU activation function (`max(0, x)`) was causing most neuron gradients to become zero. This "killed" the neurons, preventing weight updates and causing the remaining active neurons to receive pathologically large gradients, which resulted in `NaN` values.
3.  **The Solution: Leaky ReLU**: Switching to **Leaky ReLU** (`max(0.01*x, x)`) was the critical fix. It ensures a small, non-zero gradient always flows, preventing neurons from dying and stabilizing the network.
4.  **Correcting Backpropagation**: Further debugging uncovered subtle bugs in the TCN's backpropagation logic, which were corrected to ensure gradients flowed correctly through the temporal layers.

## Final Optimizations and Validation

With a stable training pipeline, the focus shifted to final model optimization and validation.

1.  **Improving Training with Adam**: The initial SGD optimizer was replaced with the **Adam optimizer**. This significantly improved training dynamics, leading to faster convergence and a more robust final model.

2.  **Aggressive Model Miniaturization**: To meet the strict embedded memory constraints and prevent overfitting, the model's capacity was aggressively reduced. The number of channels in the TCN layers was progressively lowered, first from 8 to 4, and finally to an **ultra-lean 2-channel architecture**. This minimal model proved highly effective, achieving ~98% validation accuracy.

3.  **Sanity Check: Validating Genuine Learning**: To ensure the high accuracy wasn't an artifact of a bug, a rigorous sanity check was performed. By deliberately **shuffling the labels** of the training data, we broke the correlation between data and labels. When the model was trained on this shuffled dataset, its validation accuracy dropped to ~33% (random chance for a 3-class problem). This result proved that the model is genuinely learning the underlying patterns in the data and not simply memorizing the training set or exploiting a flaw in the pipeline.

## Conclusion

By successfully evolving the project from a static model to a temporal one and solving the complex challenges of C-based TCN training, the project fully realizes its goal. The final application is a powerful, high-fidelity simulation of an advanced embedded AI system, demonstrating a production-ready pattern for deploying temporal models on resource-constrained devices. The final model is not only accurate but has been validated to be learning correctly and is lean enough for its target hardware.
