Project Plan: RA8D1-Constrained Simulation on macOS
Mission: To build and validate the entire adaptive learning workflow on a macOS machine, while strictly adhering to the memory and computational constraints of the Renesas RA8D1 microcontroller. This simulation will replace the real IMU sensor with a data stream from a hand position recognizer but will otherwise be functionally identical to the final embedded system.

Core Principle: "Simulate, Don't Assume." We will not use any of the Mac's convenient, high-level libraries for the core logic. Every function that will run on the MCU will be written in pure C/C++, and we will manually enforce memory limits.

Key Technologies:

Language: C/C++ (compiled with gcc or clang).
Data Source: A Python script running a hand recognizer (e.g., using MediaPipe) that sends data over a local socket.
ML Model Format: ONNX
ML Runtime: The same C/C++ ONNX inference runtime you'll use on the MCU.
Key Constraint: All code for the core simulation will be written as if it were for the MCUâ€”no dynamic memory allocation (malloc/new), static buffers, and a strict memory budget.
Four-Phase Implementation Plan for macOS Simulation
Phase 1: The "Fake MCU" and Environment Setup (Week 1)
Goal: Create a C/C++ project that serves as the "firmware" and establish communication with a data source.
Tasks:
Project Structure: Create a new folder on your Mac. Inside, create a main.c file and a Makefile. This will be your primary development environment.
Define Constraints: In a mcu_constraints.h header file, define the RA8D1's memory limits. This serves as a constant reminder and can be used for runtime checks.
Generated c
#define RA8D1_SRAM_BUDGET_KB 1024
#define RA8D1_FLASH_BUDGET_KB 2048
// Our application's self-imposed SRAM limit
#define APP_SRAM_LIMIT (256 * 1024) // 256 KB
Use code with caution.
C
Data Source (Python): Create a separate Python script. Use the MediaPipe library to get hand landmark data from your webcam. Write code to stream the X, Y, Z coordinates of a few key landmarks (e.g., fingertips, wrist) over a local TCP or UDP socket. This script mimics the IMU.
Data Receiver (C++): In your C++ project, write the socket client code to receive the hand landmark data from your Python script. This replaces the I2C driver on the MCU. The received data should be placed into a statically allocated float buffer, just as it would be in hal_entry.c.
Phase 2: Offline Model Training & ONNX Integration (Week 2)
Goal: Train a classifier and integrate the ONNX runtime into your C++ simulation.
Tasks:
Data Collection: Run your Python and C++ apps simultaneously. In Python, perform a few distinct hand gestures (e.g., "flat palm," "fist," "pointing") and save the streamed landmark data to labeled CSV files.
Model Training (Python): In a Jupyter Notebook or Python script, train a simple 1D CNN or a Fully Connected Network on the collected gesture data.
Export to ONNX: Export the trained model to model.onnx.
Integrate ONNX Runtime (C++): Compile the C/C++ ONNX runtime source files into your project. Convert your model.onnx file into a model.h C header file.
Static Memory Allocation: In your main.c, statically declare all memory buffers needed by the ONNX model (input, output, and the large activation "arena" buffer).
Generated c
// In main.c
#define MODEL_INPUT_SIZE 128*3
#define MODEL_ARENA_SIZE 50*1024 // 50KB, from model analysis

static float g_model_input[MODEL_INPUT_SIZE];
static float g_model_output[NUM_CLASSES];
static uint8_t g_model_arena[MODEL_ARENA_SIZE]; // Large working buffer
Use code with caution.
C
End-to-End Inference: Connect the pieces. The main loop should now:
Receive data from the Python socket into g_model_input.
Call the ONNX runtime's run() function.
Print the classification result from g_model_output.
At this point, you have simulated the MVP.
Phase 3: Simulating On-Device Learning (Week 3)
Goal: Implement the LoRA update mechanism within the hardware constraints.
Tasks:
LoRA Math in C: Write the pure C functions for forward_lora, backward_lora, and update_weights. These should use only basic math and operate on statically allocated arrays for the LoRA matrices.
State Machine: Implement a simple state machine in your main.c's while loop: STATE_INFER, STATE_WAIT_FOR_LEARN_CMD, STATE_COLLECT_DATA, STATE_TRAIN.
Simulated User Input: Implement a simple command-line interface. For example, if you type teach_new_gesture into the terminal running your C++ app, it will switch to the learning state.
Training Loop:
When the "teach" command is received, the app collects the next full buffer of data from the hand-tracker.
It then performs a forward pass, calculates the loss, and calls your C-based LoRA backward/update functions.
You must manually verify that the total memory used by the model buffers, LoRA matrices, and gradient buffers does not exceed your APP_SRAM_LIMIT.
Phase 4: Validation and Analysis (Week 4)
Goal: Prove the concept works and analyze its feasibility for the real hardware.
Tasks:
Demonstration: Create a screen recording showing the full workflow:
The system correctly classifies known gestures.
It fails to classify a new, untrained gesture (e.g., a "thumbs up").
You issue the "teach" command and perform the new gesture.
The system now correctly classifies the "thumbs up" gesture.
Memory Audit: At the end of your main function, print a "memory report." Manually sum the sizeof() for every static array you declared to show the total simulated SRAM usage. Compare this against APP_SRAM_LIMIT.
Code Portability Check: Review your C++ code. Confirm that it contains no OS-specific calls (except for the socket code, which is clearly marked as a substitute for the I2C driver), no dynamic memory allocation, and no standard library features that wouldn't be available in the Renesas FSP.
Final Deliverable for this POC
A single, well-organized Git repository containing:

The Python_Hand_Tracker folder.
The RA8D1_Simulation folder with your main.c, Makefile, and all C/C++ source code.
A models folder with your data collection and training notebooks/scripts.
A README.md file that clearly explains how to build and run the simulation and includes your final memory audit report.
