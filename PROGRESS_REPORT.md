# Final Project Report: Hand Gesture Recognition GUI

## Project Status: Complete

This project has successfully concluded with the development of a full-featured GUI application for hand gesture recognition. The initial goal of creating a C-based simulation for an MCU evolved into building a more practical and user-friendly Python application that covers the entire machine learning workflow.

## Summary of Accomplishments

The project delivered a robust, end-to-end solution for building and testing a custom gesture recognition model. The final application provides a seamless experience, abstracting away the complexities of environment management and command-line tools.

### Key Features Delivered:

- **✅ Unified GUI Application:** A single, intuitive interface for the entire ML pipeline, built with PyQt6.

- **✅ Automated Environment Setup:** The application guides the user through a one-time setup, verifying Python environments and dependencies to ensure the system runs correctly.

- **✅ Integrated Data Collection:** A dedicated page allows users to easily record new gesture data using their camera, with clear prompts and visual feedback.

- **✅ Live-Updating Training Page:** The model training process is managed by the application and features a live-updating Matplotlib graph, providing real-time feedback on the model's accuracy and validation accuracy.

- **✅ Real-Time Inference Engine:** A final inference page uses the trained ONNX model to provide live gesture predictions from the camera feed, completing the "data-to-deployment" loop.

- **✅ Responsive and Stable Architecture:** By leveraging `QThread` for all long-running processes (data collection, training, inference), the GUI remains responsive and provides a smooth user experience.

- **✅ Dependency Conflict Resolution:** A stable two-environment setup (`venv_gui`, `venv_training`) was established to handle conflicting package requirements, particularly for TensorFlow on Apple Silicon.

### Evolution from C-Simulation to Python GUI

The project's direction shifted from a low-level C simulation to a high-level Python application. This decision was made to prioritize usability, development speed, and the creation of a more practical tool. While the concept of on-device learning with LoRA was part of the initial plan, the final implementation focuses on providing a solid foundation for the core ML workflow: data collection, training, and inference.

This polished, end-to-end application serves as a powerful and accessible tool for anyone looking to create a custom gesture recognition model.
