# Final Project Report: Hand Gesture Recognition for Renesas RA8D1

## Project Status: ðŸŽ‰ COMPLETE & FULLY FUNCTIONAL! ðŸŽ‰

**MAJOR UPDATE (July 16, 2025)**: This project has achieved its ultimate goal! The complete hand gesture recognition system is now fully operational with seamless Python GUI â†” C backend integration. The initial vision of creating a C-based simulation for embedded MCU deployment has been successfully realized with a production-ready implementation.

## Summary of Accomplishments

The project delivered a robust, end-to-end solution for building and testing a custom gesture recognition model. The final application provides a seamless experience, abstracting away the complexities of environment management and command-line tools.

### Key Features Delivered:

- **âœ… Unified GUI Application:** A single, intuitive interface for the entire ML pipeline, built with PyQt6.

- **âœ… Automated Environment Setup:** The application guides the user through a one-time setup, verifying Python environments and dependencies to ensure the system runs correctly.

- **âœ… Integrated Data Collection:** A dedicated page allows users to easily record new gesture data using their camera, with clear prompts and visual feedback.

- **âœ… Live-Updating Training Page:** The model training process is managed by the application and features a live-updating Matplotlib graph, providing real-time feedback on the model's accuracy and validation accuracy.

- **âœ… Real-Time Inference Engine:** A final inference page uses the trained ONNX model to provide live gesture predictions from the camera feed, completing the "data-to-deployment" loop.

- **âœ… Responsive and Stable Architecture:** By leveraging `QThread` for all long-running processes (data collection, training, inference), the GUI remains responsive and provides a smooth user experience.

- **âœ… Dependency Conflict Resolution:** A stable two-environment setup (`venv_gui`, `venv_training`) was established to handle conflicting package requirements, particularly for TensorFlow on Apple Silicon.

### C Backend Integration Achievement ðŸš€

**BREAKTHROUGH**: The project successfully achieved its original vision! Rather than abandoning the C-based simulation, we completed the full integration:

- **âœ… C Neural Network Implementation**: Complete neural network training and inference in pure C with static memory allocation
- **âœ… Embedded Memory Constraints**: Enforced 1MB SRAM limit matching Renesas RA8D1 specifications
- **âœ… Socket Communication**: Robust TCP communication between Python GUI and C inference server
- **âœ… Automated Process Management**: Intelligent startup script (`start_app.sh`) orchestrating both components
- **âœ… Production-Ready Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with Python handling UI and C handling ML

### Final Integration Breakthrough

The last major challenge was resolved through:
1. **Process Orchestration**: Created automated startup script managing C server and GUI lifecycle
2. **Connection Reliability**: Eliminated race conditions and timing issues
3. **Robust Communication**: Established stable Python GUI â†” C backend socket communication

This represents the **complete realization** of the original embedded ML simulation concept - a high-fidelity representation of how neural networks would operate on bare-metal embedded systems, wrapped in an intuitive GUI interface.
